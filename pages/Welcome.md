Welcome to my blog :raising_hand_woman:!

I wanted to create a space where I could document my daily activities.

Honestly I made this website mostly for myself. It's is a place where I can document photos, videos, activities, and memories with friends. Kind of like a digital journal!
But I also want it to be something that I can share with family and friends to keep them up to date on my activities...(not that I do too many exciting activities lol)

But I hope you enjoy going through the site! I will try to keep it pretty up to date, and let me know if you have any suggestions!
