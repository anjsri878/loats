Hello! Welcome to my blog :) My name is Anjana, and I am glad you decided to stop by.

I am 20 years old and just graduated from [UC San Diego HDSI](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/mission-and-goals/) :woman_technologist:


This is a picture of me on the beach :palm_tree:!

I have a few hobbies that I really enjoy, like dancing, playing the piano, doing arts and crafts, and cooking. There's not too much that I don't enjoy doing...I'm always ready to go on adventures and try new things.
