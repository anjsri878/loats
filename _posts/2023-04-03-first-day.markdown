Hello everyone!!!! First day of the blog AHHHHHH!!
This is a lie because I am actually writing this three days after I made the blog...lol.
But yeah I was feeling really bored with my time off and decided to make a website because it's something that I've been wanting to do for a long time and now I finally have free time to do it.

The creation of the blog was a slightly lengthy process because I really wanted to use Jekyll - it's been recommended so many times to me as an efficient way to make a website and I mostly liked that it gave a really clean output. So, I sat at this cute cafe in nyc called Gotan and learned how to use Jekyll. The cafe was really cute and I loved the aesthetic but it was lowkey wack because there was no wifi...but there were outlets??? So they didn't want people working but still gave outlets??? idk it was a very confusing situation. But I ended up staying there for around three-four hours. I was actually there to meet Heramb, one of my brother's close friends and also now one of my friends, but he came two hours late so I was just watching Jekyll tutorials for a bit.

Some cute pics of the cafe!

The coffee was alright and so was the oatmeal...but also I don't think
