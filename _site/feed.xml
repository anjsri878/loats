Welcome back to another post - this one is going to be long (as is the next one..lol) so feel free to skim, skip, and navigate this post in whatever way you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start off with some &lt;strong&gt;background&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just came back from Europe!!! Before this trip I had never been to Europe; I haven’t traveled internationally too much (only India and New Zealand and a Carnival Cruise to Mexico in 2nd grade which I don’t think counts) and I’ve been wanting to visit Europe for a long time now. But when I first thought about taking a trip, I didn’t even know how to begin planning it. I had no idea what areas to stay in, the kind of accommodations to book, train tickets, nothing; this was expected since I’d never been and my parents hadn’t either. I also didn’t have the energy or brain capacity to do all of the research, planning, and booking by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was December 2022 and I wanted to book a trip before prices became too expensive. I was home for winter break and thinking of different ways I could travel to Europe. I thought of my dear friend Anuraag and the solo trip he took to Europe last year with gadventures, a travel company that did tours across the world (they even had tours specifically for 18-30somethings, which is what I was interested in). The idea of a tour group was appealing to me; I’d still get the “solo” element that I was looking for, because I wouldn’t know anyone in the group, but would also feel more safe and comfortable traveling with other people my age and being led by a tour guide. A strong pro for gadventures versus another kind of tour group (such as Contiki or Intrepid) was that I knew someone that had gone and enjoyed the trip. Once I made my decision, I booked the trip and kind of pushed it to the back of my mind for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to May 2023. I hadn’t allowed myself to do much research about the places I’d be going on my trip. By that I mean I did no research at all. I kind of wanted to go on the trip with no expectations for the places I was traveling to. I didn’t want to have a checklist of things I had to do or things I had to see because I didn’t want to put pressure on myself during the actual trip. That turned out to be great for me and made the trip even more amazing than I had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s move on to the fun stuff. The trip had a very packed itinerary - we were on the move almost every 2 or 3 days, so things were moving very quickly. Here’s an outline of the trip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:round_pushpin: Day 1 - Land in Paris &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 2 - Paris &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 3 - Train to Interlaken, Switzerland &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 4 - Interlaken &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 5 - Interlaken &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 6 - Train to Rome, Italy &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 7 - Rome &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 8 - Train to Rapallo, Italy &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 9 - Rapallo &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 10 - Train to  Nice, France &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 11 - Nice, France &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 12 - Fly to Barcelona, Spain &lt;br /&gt;
:round_pushpin: Day 13 - Fly home &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah…pretty packed. This post is going to be kind of a day-by-day format, so feel free to skip around to the days that interest you :D. They were also written on the actual day the events took place, so just be aware that it is not in past tense, but in the present tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, though let me introduce the CAST OF CHARACTERS. This might be kind of weird but I feel it’s necessary to put a face to the names of the people I will be talking about, just so you feel more involved in the storytelling lol. And yes, I had to make a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cast of characters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1 - 5/07 - arrival and first day in Paris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Bonjour from Paris 🥖 🥐 🇫🇷  !! It feels surreal to actually be in Europe - I have been awaiting this day for many many months and it is BANANAS that it’s finally arrived. After two very manageable flights, I landed in Paris CDG airport at around 9:15am. When we landed, we got off the plane and straight into a bus that took us to border patrol, which took only about a half hour to go through. There was no customs, which was quite strange, and after I collected my luggage, I headed to the hostel address sent to us by the tour company. I wasn’t sure what to expect because we had not been given any contact information for our tour guide or other people in the tour group; I was basically going into it blind. There was the only the address we were supposed to meet at, so I hoped everything would work out and hopped in an uber to the hostel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the hostel around 11 - it was a huge 9 story building filled with people and it had so much going on. There was a lovely common space, music, games, and people just talking and having a good time. I got the keys to my room and went upstairs - two girls had left their belongings in the room but no one else was actually there when I came in for the first time. I took a much needed shower and afterwards, felt ready to go on an adventure. My first mission was to get a croissant :croissant: . I mapped it to a bakery close by (there were so many so I just randomly picked one) and began my walk. As I was walking I took my time to just soak in the city; I would follow roads that looked appealing to me and walked inside shops that looked cute. My first impression was that Paris is adorable - everything was quaint and simple, and life seemed more enjoyable there. The buildings were so charming, and everyone was dining outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/firstday_streets.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;streets&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A funny thing about Paris is that they turn the chairs so that they all face the street; the people dining are basically enjoying a free show (watching the people on the street), and I could see them judging everyone that walked by. It was quite strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into a bakery called Liberte and got a chocolate croissant. One thing I didn’t expect was to be nervous walking into stores and ordering things; this is the first place I’ve ever been with a language barrier, and so I didn’t anticipate the nerves that came with that. But everyone speaks English so it ended up not being a problem.  I ate the croissant in under two minutes and went to explore more in search of a coffee. I walked by the canal and down lovely small streets lined with flowers and cute restaurants. I love the culture of eating outdoors despite the weather and how all the chairs face out towards the street. I got coffee at a cute place called La Fontaine, where the chef (and the place itself) looked straight out of Emily in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still hadn’t eaten lunch but had struggled to read menus and find veggie options in some places. I finally got a veg sandwich on a long thin baguette - it was delicious. But at this time, as I was strolling and eating the sandwich, it also started pouring. I made my way back to the hostel after my 2 hour adventure and changed out of my wet clothes. Soon after, I met my first roommate, Rose from Quebec! She spoke French but we managed to converse pretty well in English. I then took a 2 hour nap, before waking up again at 5:30. I met my second roommate, Jordyn, who is from Saskatchewan, Canada, and then we all headed down to the lobby to meet the rest of the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting everyone was SO NICE! There are 16 of us - a pretty big group. Our tour leader Barbara is this small Italian lady with a lot of energy and a sweet sweet personality. She brought her French boyfriend Pierre to meet us - he was also gorgeous. He looked like a French model and was the nicest person ever. We played two truths and a lie, and then headed out for a group dinner. It felt like Barbara and Pierre were our mom and dad, escorting us across the city.
Barbara made a reservation for us at this lovely place called Bouillon, which had a huge line of people waiting out the door. We got in immediately and were escorted upstairs to a huge room, filled with large parties. The restaurant was beautiful and filled with chatter and good vibes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/firstday_bouillon.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;bouillon&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner was so lovely and spent talking to new people. I sat with a couple of Australian girls and one Kiwi. Everyone is so sweet and chatty, which I loved. We drank and ate and had a lovely time together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner everyone was exhausted so we headed back to the hostel to get ready for bed. My roomies - Jordyn, Casey, and Rose - and I stayed up chatting for a bit. I took a shower and then we all went to bed. It was such a good first day and I know it’s only going to get better from here! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2 - 5/08 - Full day in Paris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up early and started the day off with some hostel breakfast. It was kind of lame - just plain untoasted pieces of baguettes with jam and butter. I don’t think the French eat any real fruits or vegetables; honestly, I the meals I most frequently saw people eating were plain baguettes, baguettes with ham and cheese, or just cigarettes. lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we had an orientation walk around Paris; basically that means that Barbara and Pierre took us on a tour around the city, showing us a lot of the highlights, taking us to some special viewpoints, and getting us some good food, like fresh croissants and sandwiches. We started off the walk by taking the Metro (not walking, ik)! It was so sleek and nice - I appreciated it because it was quite easy to navigate, even without google maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was Boulangerie 28, a delicious bakery where Barbara and Pierre got us fresh croissants and these heavenly chouquettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/chouquette.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;sacrecoure&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took our pastries to go and continued on our walk; we saw the grand City Hall, the Notre Dame, and spent time walking along the Seine. Babi and Pierre took us to this secret vewipoint where we could see the Louvre, boats on the river, and could people watch the Parisians - it was so lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/notredame.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;nd&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was the Eiffel Tower. We took the metro to the Eiffel Tower stop and picked up food and groceries for a picnic. The whole group found a spot in the lawn by tower and had our picnic! It was definitely one of the highlights of the trip - very cute and wholesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/eiffeltower.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;et&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we took some more pics and the group split up (the mormons took a lot of couples pics lol). Some of the peeps and I headed over to the French pantheon and Latin quarter, and also spent some time walking around the Luxembourg gardens. We were all tired so then we went to the hostel to rest before the evening activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, Pierre and Barbara took us on an adventure. We saw the Moulin Rouge building and the street lined with a bunch of sex shops (from Amelie!!). We got a dessert called a Marveilloux… it’s basically a super light Meringue filled with flavored cream. It was by far the most amazing dessert I’ve ever eaten. After that we walked through Montemart and to the Sacre Coure Basilica - one of my fav buildings to see in Paris! Montemart was so adorable and and had cute shops and restaurants lining the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/marveilloux.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;marveilloux&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner that night was at a tiny northern French specialty crepe place called Creperie Octopus. Barbara and Pierre took us here claiming that it was the most authentic French food we would get. And they were right… it was the best thing I ate in Paris (and looking back, one of the best things I ate the entire trip). The food was so authentic and good and fresh! We enjoyed our crepes with some specialty cider local to the north of France. I loved the whole evening and the weather, sunset, good company, and wonderful food made the energy perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we took the metro to the Eiffel Tower to see it sparkling at night! On the metro ride there, we witnessed a live pickpocketing!! But it was unsuccessful; the guy being pickpocketed caught the guy trying to steal from him…lol.
Seeing the glittering Eiffel tower truly was so beautiful. It seems very cheesy but seeing the dazzling tower made us all feel emotional and appreciative that we were on this trip together. There were couples dancing everywhere and someone playing some love songs and just the magic of the moment will stay with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the metro home and went to bed, exhausted froma long day of adventuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/eiffelsparkling.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;eiffelsparkling&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3 - 5/09 - Paris to Interlaken&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start the day off, Rose and I went to get breakfast - I got an INCREDIBLE pistachio cream filled croissant and a small latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/travel/paris/pistacros.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;pistacros&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two of us sat there and talked and ate for around 45 min before we headed out to shop. We took the metro to this area caled the Marais, where we walked along the main shopping street and stopped at cute French boutiques. Went to one called Nōs by Mirene, and Rose and I both fell in love with all of the stuff. I ended up getting a beautiful blue and green dress, and a lovely top. Then we window-shopped around some more before heading back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a long transit day because we were traveling from Paris to Interlaken, Switzerland. From our hostel, we took the metro to the train station and spent some time at the boujee station. It was so fancy - like a mini airport! It had amazing patisseries and shops inside. I got a macaron and a marveilloux while waiting for our train. Finally, we got aboard the train to Basel. The train ride was so nice and just a chance to chat with and get to know our group mates a little better. Afterwards, we got off at Basel train station and took the train to our step, Interlaken Ost. When we got there it was pouring and we had to walk in the rain to our hostel with all our luggage, which was quite unpleasant. Finally, we got there and settled in - our group went out for a chill dinner and afterwards, were all very tired so we passed out asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make shorter posts so that they are easier to take in and because there are just a ton of details about this trip that I want to share. Stay tuned for the next couple of posts! Side note:  I put a decent amount of effort into making that table up there and I’m quite proud of it…hehe. Hopefully you can use it as a reference in my future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xoxo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helloooo everyone - I left San Diego!! Which seems bizarre to think about, but it’s happened. I think packing up my boxes into the car and finally emptying out my room made it feel like I was finally done with college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After coming back from New York, I was actually pretty sick but tried to ignore the fact that I was sick so it was just me not taking care of myself and then getting sicker. It was not great lol. But I spent the first week back going kickboxing, hitting my favorite coffee shops (also peep my new &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/coffeeshops&quot;&gt;coffee shops&lt;/a&gt; page on the blog hehe) and packing up my room. There was more to pack then I anticipated but I would just put on some music or YouTube videos and grind for a couple hours to get things packed. Going through all of the stuff in my room was strange because 1) I realized I have way too many clothes and have a serious shopping issue but also 2) that college went by insanely fast. I found brochures for school events, notebooks from my freshman year classes, and birthday cards from friends; it was crazy to think that this phase of my life is coming to an end and I’ll have to leave behind a lot of the people and memories that made college wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday the 16th I made a day trip to USC to take grad pics for Aditi and her friends. I always love being on the USC campus because it’s everything that UCSD is not lol; it’s a small, lovely campus with the typical brick-building feel that I always associate with colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/16_04_aditi.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;me aditi lulu&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/16_04_aditi2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;me aditi&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the day there taking pictures for her and her friends - I always love seeing Aditi because whenever we spend time together it’s like no time has passed in between. But I think being out all day made my ongoing sickness even worse and the next morning I woke up with no voice and a painfully raw sore throat lol. :face_with_thermometer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent Monday resting at home in bed, but then felt better enough to go out again on Tuesday. I kept up with kickboxing, coffee drinking, and seeing people. It was actually so great and much needed quality time with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/19_04_manav.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;manavs house&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/14_04_brunch.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;ritika brunch&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spent a lot of quality time with Anya and Siyona, which is always really nice. The weather starting getting really nice towards the end of the week, and the three of us went out on a cute coffee date to MRKT space on Thursday, and just talked for a long time. I saw Varun that evening and we watched the sunset at Gliderport, which was gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/20_04_gliderport.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gp1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/20_04_gp2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gp2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was such a perfect day. I started off the day with kickboxing - my last class :sadface: Anya, Siyona, and I had a beach day on Friday because the weather was in the 70s - we packed a picnic and hung out at Del Mar beach for a couple of hours :ocean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_beach.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;girls at the beach&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_beach2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;beach view&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_picnic.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;picnic&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was actually warm enough to swim in the ocean, which was so lovely. I lost my sunglasses to the ocean - a sacrifice that I was not ready to make. After the beach we went to some rooftop complex close by and just sat there for a while chatting, drinking coffee, and decompressing. It’s so nice to have no responsibilities right now because I can fully enjoy days like that, spent relaxing and just living life without any hassle. We watched the sunset that evening and then Anya, Saket, and I got dinner together at Buona Forchetta South Park, which is one of my favorite Italian places in SD. We finished the night up with the new season of Indian Matchmaking and then went to bed. It was such a good day!! :sunny:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_sunset.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gp day 2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday was the day my parents were coming down from the Bay Area. They were coming down on Saturday to SD and we were going to drive back home on Sunday. I started off the morning by going to Holsem Coffee in North Park (one of my favorite shops) and got a bagel and coffee for myself to start the day :coffee: I also went to Pigment and got myself some new sunglasses :sunglasses:. My parents were arriving later that day so I did some cleaning and last minute packing before they came. They finally arrived at around 3:30pm, and we went to La Jolla Shores for some food and beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/22_04_beach.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;lj shores&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I took them to Liberty Station - we hung out at Moniker and drank some good coffee before going to the Public Market and getting some food. Then we headed home to pack up the car with all of my stuff (mostly clothes…lol). My parents, my roommates and I chatted for some time which was cute. The roomies and I watched some more Indian Matchmaking and then went to bed. :zzz:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents and I left San Diego and started our drive home at around 9:30 the next morning, with a long car ride ahead of us. We love to make a lot of stops lol so I knew we’d be on the road for at least 10 hours. On the way home we stopped in Santa Barbara :palm_tree: it was my first time there and I reallyyyyy loved it. After a couple of stops and a lot of driving (none of it done by me because my dad wouldn’t let me drive) we made it home at 10pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/23_04_sb.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;santa barbara&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 3 days since coming home and I’ve been just enjoying relaxing and being pampered. The weather has been in the 70s and 80s and I sit in the backyard everyday soaking in the sun and working on this blog. My neighbors dog barks at me frequently from his backyard - he’s kind of a brat to me but he loves my parents. His name is Buddy and he hangs out at my house sometimes - my parents take care of him when they miss the feeling of having a child in the house. But when I’m back home, he doesn’t come over too much because he knows I’m the princess of the household and he can’t compete with that. There are a lot of birds in the backyard - hummingbirds, robins, huge crows (which scare me) and a ton more. As I’m writing this, the crow and I are having a stare-down. All of the birds come and bathe in the many fountains and birdbaths my parents have in the yard. Our orange tree has a lot of blossoms right now and smells so good, and our pear tree is finally blossoming!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog has been keeping me very occupied. I spent the whole day yesterday trying to figure out how to make an image carousel (again, check out the new &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/coffeeshops&quot;&gt;coffee shops&lt;/a&gt; page for an example) and just refining some of the features. With jekyll these features have to all be manually created and added so it’s a little time consuming. The blog will be changing frequently so don’t be surprised if it looks different every time you open it lol. It’s nice being home but I don’t really leave the house at all. I feel like I’m in this weird limbo space because I’m in between different phases of my life right now. It’s nice but also I’ve never been one to enjoy having nothing to do - I miss my routine and work too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYWAYS, thank you for reading and being a subscriber to this blog. Even if you’re an involuntary subscriber and I just added you to the email list lol. This is my first time using the email list btw!! So let me know if there’s anything I should add / change / any suggestions you have for the blog in general. Stay tuned for more updates :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!!!! First day of the blog AHHHHHH!!
This is a lie because I am actually writing this three days after I made the blog…lol.
But yeah I was feeling really bored with my time off and decided to make a website because it’s something that I’ve been wanting to do for a long time and now I finally have free time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the blog was a slightly lengthy process because I really wanted to use Jekyll - it’s been recommended so many times to me as an efficient way to make a website and I mostly liked that it gave a really clean output. So, I sat at this cute cafe in nyc called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gotancafe.com/&quot;&gt;Gotan&lt;/a&gt; in Tribeca and learned how to use Jekyll. The cafe was really cute and I loved the aesthetic but it was lowkey wack because there was no wifi…but there were outlets??? So they didn’t want people working but still gave outlets??? idk it was a very confusing situation. But I ended up staying there for around three-four hours. I was actually there to meet Heramb, one of my brother’s close friends and also now one of my friends, but he came two hours late so I was just watching Jekyll tutorials for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cute pics of the cafe!
&lt;!-- ![gotan1](anjsri878.github.io/loats/assets/img/03_04_gotan1.JPG) --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/03_04_gotan1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gotan1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/03_04_gotan2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gotan2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee was alright and so was the oatmeal…but also I don’t think I was in the position to be judging their food because I could not really eat properly. BASICALLY I’ve been having trouble because my wisdom teeth are growing in and for the past week I could not open my mouth more than half and inch because my left jaw is inflamed. So yeah eating food has been really not fun and actually quite painful. I have been sticking to coffee, smoothies, soups, and it kinda sucks :sweat:. I definitely need to come back to this place to try their sandos though because they looked really yum. Heramb got this herb omelette sandwich and it looked :fire:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours of working though, I got quite hungry. The coffee and oatmeal were definitely not enough to sustain me until dinner, so I went to find some ramen. Heramb suggested Danbo Ramen, which was in the West Village, around a 20 minute walk up from the cafe. I got there and sat by myself at the counter, and ordered their classic vegan ramen, which came with a vegan broth, thin noodles, scallions, sliced tofu and kikurage (wood ear mushrooms). Oh man that ramen was SO GOOD and hit the spot. It was still kind of hard to eat because of my jaw but I took my time and finished as much of it as I could. Definitely a 10/10 and one of the best ramens I’ve had. And it was only around $15 total!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/03_04_danbo.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;danbo&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After ramen it was almost time for me to go back home so I just stalled time for a little bit and decided to get tea (remember the only reason I was drinking so many liquids it because solid food was nearly impossible for me to fit in my mouth lmao). I just kinda walked around until I found a cute one called Amano Cafe - I just got a mint tea :tea: and then caught the F train back to Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/03_04_tea.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;amano&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the evening watching Atlanta and drinking a smoothie before going to bed. :zzz:&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
