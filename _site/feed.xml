Which seems bizarre to think about, but it’s happened. I think packing up my boxes into the car and finally emptying out my room made it feel like I was finally done with college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After coming back from New York, I was actually pretty sick but tried to ignore the fact that I was sick so it was just me not taking care of myself and then getting sicker. It was not great lol. But I spent the first week back going kickboxing, hitting my favorite coffee shops (also peep my new &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/coffeeshops&quot;&gt;coffee shops&lt;/a&gt; page on the blog hehe) and packing up my room. There was more to pack then I anticipated but I would just put on some music or YouTube videos and grind for a couple hours to get things packed. Going through all of the stuff in my room was strange because 1) I realized I have way too many clothes and have a serious shopping issue but also 2) that college went by insanely fast. I found brochures for school events, notebooks from my freshman year classes, and birthday cards from friends; it was crazy to think that this phase of my life is coming to an end and I’ll have to leave behind a lot of the people and memories that made college wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday the 16th I made a day trip to USC to take grad pics for Aditi and her friends. I always love being on the USC campus because it’s everything that UCSD is not lol; it’s a small, lovely campus with the typical brick-building feel that I always associate with colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/16_04_aditi.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;me aditi lulu&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/16_04_aditi2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;me aditi&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the day there taking pictures for her and her friends - I always love seeing Aditi because whenever we spend time together it’s like no time has passed in between. But I think being out all day made my ongoing sickness even worse and the next morning I woke up with no voice and a painfully raw sore throat lol. :face_with_thermometer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent Monday resting at home in bed, but then felt better enough to go out again on Tuesday. I kept up with kickboxing, coffee drinking, and seeing people. It was actually so great and much needed quality time with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/19_04_manav.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;manavs house&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/14_04_brunch.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;ritika brunch&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spent a lot of quality time with Anya and Siyona, which is always really nice. The weather starting getting really nice towards the end of the week, and the three of us went out on a cute coffee date to MRKT space on Thursday, and just talked for a long time. I saw Varun that evening and we watched the sunset at Gliderport, which was gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/20_04_gliderport.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gp1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/20_04_gp2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gp2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was such a perfect day. I started off the day with kickboxing - my last class :sadface: Anya, Siyona, and I had a beach day on Friday because the weather was in the 70s - we packed a picnic and hung out at Del Mar beach for a couple of hours :ocean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_beach.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;girls at the beach&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_beach2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;beach view&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_picnic.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;picnic&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was actually warm enough to swim in the ocean, which was so lovely. I lost my sunglasses to the ocean - a sacrifice that I was not ready to make. After the beach we went to some rooftop complex close by and just sat there for a while chatting, drinking coffee, and decompressing. It’s so nice to have no responsibilities right now because I can fully enjoy days like that, spent relaxing and just living life without any hassle. We watched the sunset that evening and then Anya, Saket, and I got dinner together at Buona Forchetta South Park, which is one of my favorite Italian places in SD. We finished the night up with the new season of Indian Matchmaking and then went to bed. It was such a good day!! :sunny:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/21_04_sunset.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;gp day 2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday was the day my parents were coming down from the Bay Area. They were coming down on Saturday to SD and we were going to drive back home on Sunday. I started off the morning by going to Holsem Coffee in North Park (one of my favorite shops) and got a bagel and coffee for myself to start the day :coffee: I also went to Pigment and got myself some new sunglasses :sunglasses:. My parents were arriving later that day so I did some cleaning and last minute packing before they came. They finally arrived at around 3:30pm, and we went to La Jolla Shores for some food and beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/22_04_beach.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;lj shores&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I took them to Liberty Station - we hung out at Moniker and drank some good coffee before going to the Public Market and getting some food. Then we headed home to pack up the car with all of my stuff (mostly clothes…lol). My parents, my roommates and I chatted for some time which was cute. The roomies and I watched some more Indian Matchmaking and then went to bed. :zzz:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents and I left San Diego and started our drive home at around 9:30 the next morning, with a long car ride ahead of us. We love to make a lot of stops lol so I knew we’d be on the road for at least 10 hours. On the way home we stopped in Santa Barbara :palm_tree: it was my first time there and I reallyyyyy loved it. After a couple of stops and a lot of driving (none of it done by me because my dad wouldn’t let me drive) we made it home at 10pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/23_04_sb.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;santa barbara&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 3 days since coming home and I’ve been just enjoying relaxing and being pampered. The weather has been in the 70s and 80s and I sit in the backyard everyday soaking in the sun and working on this blog. My neighbors dog barks at me frequently from his backyard - he’s kind of a brat to me but he loves my parents. His name is Buddy and he hangs out at my house sometimes - my parents take care of him when they miss the feeling of having a child in the house. But when I’m back home, he doesn’t come over too much because he knows I’m the princess of the household and he can’t compete with that. There are a lot of birds in the backyard - hummingbirds, robins, huge crows (which scare me) and a ton more. As I’m writing this, the crow and I are having a stare-down. All of the birds come and bathe in the many fountains and birdbaths my parents have in the yard. Our orange tree has a lot of blossoms right now and smells so good, and our pear tree is finally blossoming!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog has been keeping me very occupied. I spent the whole day yesterday trying to figure out how to make an image carousel (again, check out the new &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/coffeeshops&quot;&gt;coffee shops&lt;/a&gt; page for an example) and just refining some of the features. With jekyll these features have to all be manually created and added so it’s a little time consuming. The blog will be changing frequently so don’t be surprised if it looks different every time you open it lol. It’s nice being home but I don’t really leave the house at all. I feel like I’m in this weird limbo space because I’m in between different phases of my life right now. It’s nice but also I’ve never been one to enjoy having nothing to do - I miss my routine and work too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYWAYS, thank you for reading and being a subscriber to this blog. Even if you’re an involuntary subscriber and I just added you to the email list lol. This is my first time using the email list btw!! So let me know if there’s anything I should add / change / any suggestions you have for the blog in general. Stay tuned for more updates :)&lt;/p&gt;

I kind of already talked about one day of the trip in the previous post but there is a lot more to cover. I wasn’t posting everyday because I just wanted to spend time with Albert when I was in ny and could not be bothered to keep up with posting lol. But also there were some image issues I needed to debug and just other parts of the website I wanted to get right before making a new post.
ANYWAYS back to the real content :envelope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip was so nice and basically I went because I really needed to find an apartment!!!! Which I successfully did after like two months of searching and going back and forth trying to find a place. It’s a really nice sunny, spacious 2 bedroom apartment in the Kensington / Windsor Terrace neighborhood of Brooklyn. I honestly lovvvve the area so much. My place is directly across the street from Prospect Park, the Kensington dog park (!!! :dog2:), and there are a ton of cute coffee shops, restaurants and grocery stores super close by. To be fair, I have spent a good amount of time here because Albert lives in literally the same neighborhood (5 min away!!) and I got to know the area pretty well. The apartment is perfect because it’s designed for hosting and having people over, which I really enjoy doing. I should get a roommate but I want to enjoy having a place all to myself for a while and I don’t feel bad about it. I really want to take my time decorating the place and not just buy all the furniture at once. I’ll be living here for a while so I want to look around on FB marketplace, stores in NY, and take my time to find pieces I really like. Now that the apartment is secure it’ll be nice to focus on the fun part, which is furnishing and decorating :couch_and_lamp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole week was really nice and chill. In the last post I talked about going into the city on Monday of that week. Tuesday I mostly spent at home, chilling and watching TV and napping and working a little bit on the website. Then after Albert finished his workday we went on a little adventure to Industry city. Basically, it was a bunch of warehouses that got converted into a strip of food markets, kind of like Chelsea market but a lot less crowded and more spread out. It was a mix of these indoor food markets and a cute outdoor area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/04_04_industrycity.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;industry city&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We biked over there and spent some time exploring and hanging out there. Then we went to Costco and picked up some essentials and then went back home. It was a cute evening adventure! We went home and watched Atlanta until we were too tired :zzz:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was another day in the city for me. I really wanted to go to Maman because I was craving their mocha (I don’t know where this craving came from but it was very strong). I went to one of their locations near 23rd street and found a table. I still was having problems eating (because of my wisdom teeth issues) so I couldn’t get anything from their divine pastry cabinet, and head to get a mocha and tomato soup instead. I mean it was still really good but it was a missed opportunity to get one of their insanely good pastries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/05_04_maman1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;maman1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/05_04_maman2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;maman2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a really long time there - three hours I think? - just reading. I had picked up Normal People by Sally Rooney from a bookstore in Seattle a few months before and finally had time to read it. I got through a lot of it at Maman but eventually I looked up and realized I needed some outdoor time. I still wanted to finish the book though, so I walked up around 20 minutes to the NYPL, and made my way to the Rose Reading room, which is so so gorgeous. We weren’t allowed to take pictures in the room but I tried to take a sneaky pic of the ceiling (and kind of failed?? but also kind of succeeded?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/05_04_roseroom2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;rrr&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished the book (which was very very good and I strongly recommend) and made my way out of the library to Bryant Park which was just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/05_04_nypl1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;nypl1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/05_04_nypl2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;nypl2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I gained some more confidence in my ability to eat things and also I was just really hungry so I went to Le Pain near bryant park and got a croissant, danish, and hot chocolate :croissant: I was really hungry LOL and was trying to test the limit of my eating capabilities. Then I met up with Albert and we took the train home together. It was a chill evening of watching TV, cooking, and hanging out in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday was one of my favorite days during the week. It was beautiful weather - around 70 degrees - and the warmest it had been all week. Albert and I took a short walk to Elk Cafe in the morning and walked through the park and back. Because he was working, I decided I wanted to go on a solo adventure. First I went to downtown Brooklyn because I just wanted to go to Sephora but I ended up just browsing and didn’t end up buying anything. I walked through downtown and came across a cute library, where I read some poetry and kind of just explored. It was my Grandpa’s birthday and he was a librarian for a lot of his life - I wanted to read some of his favorite poets to remember him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/06_04_downtown.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;downtownbk&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/06_04_bhpl.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;bhpl&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I wanted to buy some more stuff for the charcuterie board we were going to make on Friday, but I specifically wanted to go to a specialty food store to try and find some unique things. I ended up in Brooklyn heights and it was SUCH a CUUUTE neighborhood. The buildings were all beautiful brownstones and just lovely foliage and ivy everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/06_04_bkheights1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;bkheights&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having the time of my life just walking around and romanticizing my life to the max. I came across this cute bookstore called Books Are Magic and got another Sally Rooney book, Conversations with Friends, which I ended up finishing on the flight home. I kept walking through the neighborhood then mapped it to a random specialty food store called Sahadi’s which had good reviews. On the way I stopped in this cute bakery called Amy’s Bread to get some sweet buns as a snack. When I finally got to Sahadi’s, I realized that there were like 5 specialty stores in a row and that I had hit the jackpot. I walked into Sahadi’s and fell in love. It was a Lebanese / Middle eastern store and it was so so wonderful. Right when I entered there were huge barrels of coffee that were being roasted and large containers of nuts and dried fruits, jams, and other foods. Then they had a bunch of freshly prepared things like Za’atar chips, hummus, baba ghanoush, and so much more. I went crazy in there and got a bunch of things for the coochie board. Then I left the store and immediately next to it was another lebanese place but this one had fresh flatbreads, pies, baklava, dolma, and more hummus, tabbouleh, and SO MUCH fresh food. I got a meat pie for Albert and a spinach feta pie for myself and then left to take the train back home. I came back and Albert and I had late lunch while I debriefed my adventure. Then I chilled and watched TV and napped at some point. That evening we watched more Atlanta - I think this was the night we watched the Teddy Perkins episode, which was quite scary but one of the most amazing things I’ve ever watched. To be fair I had my eyes closed for the last 10 minutes, but I still listened to everything going on. Went to bed exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was also a lovely day. Woke up and got coffee then biked with Albert the Brooklyn Public library, the biggest library in Brooklyn :classical_building:. It was a cold day and we knew that if we didn’t leave the house then, we wouldn’t get out all day. He did some work and I worked on my website for a while then I decided I really wanted Ramen. We randomly came across this place called Kyuramen, which ended up being really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/07_04_kyuramen.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;ramen&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our own little personal booth with a privacy curtain and the ramen was also very good :ramen: We took the train home and watched TV for a bit and just lounged. In the evening, we had planned to make the charcuterie board with the assortment of items we had bought throughout the week, from the Industry City food stores and my Thursday adventures. We set up the board (which if I may say, was quite beautiful), had some wine, and watched the Knicks game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/07_04_charboard.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;coochie board&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert’s bestie came over and we all just hung, smoked a little, and chilled. It was very nice just all around good vibes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday was a cute and adventurous day. In the morning, I had the apartment inspection and took Albert with me. It was really nice to see the place again and we got the see the common roof area too, which was awesome. I can definitely see myself having people over up there during the summer and warmer evenings.
After the inspection Albert and I went to the Guggenheim museum in the UES. We mostly just clowned on the exhibits - I’m not a super big fan of modern art??? I could honestly make most of those things myself…but I respect it. The coolest part of the museum was the actual building, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and was actually awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/08_04_guggenheim.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;ggmuseum&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/08_04_cherryblossoms.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;cb&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the museum, we walked through the park to see the cherry blossoms. Albert showed me his high school which was a few blocks down and it was cool to see something from that era of his life. We got dinner at a cute french place filled with rich old white people from the Upper East side talking about things only rich white people talk about. Houses on islands, their kids’ art studios, etc. It was very amusing. We went home exhausted and crashed early, watching some TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was Easter so Albert was going for a family lunch. I met Pranita in the city and we got lunch at Planta Queen, this AMAZING vegan restaurant in the city. I typically have a bias against vegan restaurants but this was literally so good. We got vegan sushi and these amazing noodles and crispy gyoza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/09_04_plantaqueen.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;pq1&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/09_04_plantaqueen2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;pq2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we got coffee and gossiped some more. I’m happy Pranita is going to be in the city because she’s a sweet friend and I hope we get to hang some more. Went home and watched TV and read my book while waiting for Albert to come back. When he did, we took a little nap. Then we got up and watched the last Austin Powers while eating Easter sweets he brought back from the lunch. We had some good talks and then went to bed :zzz:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning was Monday, the day I was leaving. In the morning we went for a long walk through the park and got smoothies and acai bowls. Then chilled at home, took a short nap, and then out for another short walk adventure. I left for the airport and got home late that night. It was honestly such a wonderful week and I’m always sad to leave ny and Albert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Came back to San Diego and spent Tuesday just resetting my life back home. Unpacked, cleaned a lot, cooked, grocery shopped, ran errands, and spent time with Siyona and Anya. Today, I went back to kickboxing :boxing_glove: (felt so good after the last 2 weeks), made bfast for Anya and Adi, who is staying with us for today, and then the three of us went to Moniker Coffee to work, where I am sitting and writing this right now. It’s been a lovely day so far and I’m happy to be back to my routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/12_04_moniker1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;pq2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!!!! First day of the blog AHHHHHH!!
This is a lie because I am actually writing this three days after I made the blog…lol.
But yeah I was feeling really bored with my time off and decided to make a website because it’s something that I’ve been wanting to do for a long time and now I finally have free time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the blog was a slightly lengthy process because I really wanted to use Jekyll - it’s been recommended so many times to me as an efficient way to make a website and I mostly liked that it gave a really clean output. So, I sat at this cute cafe in nyc called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gotancafe.com/&quot;&gt;Gotan&lt;/a&gt; in Tribeca and learned how to use Jekyll. The cafe was really cute and I loved the aesthetic but it was lowkey wack because there was no wifi…but there were outlets??? So they didn’t want people working but still gave outlets??? idk it was a very confusing situation. But I ended up staying there for around three-four hours. I was actually there to meet Heramb, one of my brother’s close friends and also now one of my friends, but he came two hours late so I was just watching Jekyll tutorials for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cute pics of the cafe!

&lt;p&gt;The coffee was alright and so was the oatmeal…but also I don’t think I was in the position to be judging their food because I could not really eat properly. BASICALLY I’ve been having trouble because my wisdom teeth are growing in and for the past week I could not open my mouth more than half and inch because my left jaw is inflamed. So yeah eating food has been really not fun and actually quite painful. I have been sticking to coffee, smoothies, soups, and it kinda sucks :sweat:. I definitely need to come back to this place to try their sandos though because they looked really yum. Heramb got this herb omelette sandwich and it looked :fire:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours of working though, I got quite hungry. The coffee and oatmeal were definitely not enough to sustain me until dinner, so I went to find some ramen. Heramb suggested Danbo Ramen, which was in the West Village, around a 20 minute walk up from the cafe. I got there and sat by myself at the counter, and ordered their classic vegan ramen, which came with a vegan broth, thin noodles, scallions, sliced tofu and kikurage (wood ear mushrooms). Oh man that ramen was SO GOOD and hit the spot. It was still kind of hard to eat because of my jaw but I took my time and finished as much of it as I could. Definitely a 10/10 and one of the best ramens I’ve had. And it was only around $15 total!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/gallery/03_04_danbo.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;danbo&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After ramen it was almost time for me to go back home so I just stalled time for a little bit and decided to get tea (remember the only reason I was drinking so many liquids it because solid food was nearly impossible for me to fit in my mouth lmao). I just kinda walked around until I found a cute one called Amano Cafe - I just got a mint tea :tea: and then caught the F train back to Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the evening watching Atlanta and drinking a smoothie before going to bed. :zzz:&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
